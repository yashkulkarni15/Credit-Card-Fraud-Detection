# CREDIT-FRAUD
üîç Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based credit card fraud detection system to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. Using various classification algorithms, the model analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious activities. The system is trained on a dataset of real transactions and employs different techniques to enhance accuracy.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Fraud Detection System: Identifies fraudulent transactions based on transaction patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning Models: Utilizes Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and K-Means Clustering.
